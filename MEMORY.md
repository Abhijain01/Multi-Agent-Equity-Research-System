## Architectural Decisions (Locked)

These are final. Do not re-debate without a strong reason.

**1. LangGraph over CrewAI / AutoGen**
Reason: Explicit state machine, conditional edges, deterministic routing. Full ADR in docs/adr/ADR001.

**2. Groq (Llama-3.3-70B) over OpenAI**
Reason: Free tier, fast enough, 128K context. Full ADR in docs/adr/ADR002.

**3. Pydantic structured outputs on every agent**
Reason: Prevents malformed outputs breaking downstream agents. Every agent function returns a typed Pydantic model, never a raw string.

**4. Aggressive caching before every API call**
Reason: Avoids rate limits during development. All API responses saved to `cache/{tool}/{md5_hash_of_params}.json`. Dev loop never re-hits an API for same input.

**5. Revision hard cap at 2**
Reason: Prevents infinite critic→writer loops. After 2 failed revisions, escalate to HITL with a `needs_review` flag.

**6. Parallel data gathering (web + financial + news run simultaneously)**
Reason: Cuts pipeline latency. All three data agents run in parallel after orchestrator, not in sequence.

## Known Issues / Gotchas

- yfinance tickers for Indian stocks use `.NS` suffix (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`, `HDFCBANK.NS`)
- NewsAPI free tier returns articles up to 1 month old only. Filter by `publishedAt` date.
- Groq rate limit is per-minute, not per-day. Space out agent calls if hitting limits.
- LangGraph Python is different from LangGraph.js (used in Capital Lens). Refer to Python docs only.
